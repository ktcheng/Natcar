# Natcar
N.B. This project is finished.

# Description
This is a project pulled from an introductory electrical engineering course (EC ENGR 3 @ UCLA), in which our final project entailed programming a photosensor car. This "path sensing" car would be able to follow a set race track at the end of the course. Utilizing PID controls, the code programs the vehicle to follow a solid black line on a white background (aka the path) to its completion, performing a U-turn when reaching a solid black line, as well as completing two different race tracks (a ribbon path and a straight line path).

N.B. As with any academic code, the posting of this repository is to demonstrate the code and what I have learned, and is in no way meant to be a resource for plagiarism or cheating (copying code will only stunt your growth as a programmer anyways).

# Operation
Upload the file "Final_Project.ino" (without the quotation marks) onto the Energia photosensing car. Immediately upon startup, the car will move according to what it determines is the path. Make sure the vehicle is situated and ready on the track upon startup to ensure a complete race.
